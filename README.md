## How It Works

1. When the page loads, a modal appears asking for the user's name and phone number.
2. After submitting the information, the user can proceed to the comment section.
3. The comment section displays existing comments and a form to add new ones.
4. Each comment shows the author's name, date, and has an edit button.
5. Clicking the edit button allows the user to modify the comment text.
6. Comments can be saved after editing or the edit can be cancelled.
